# pathfinding-visual-demo
A visual demonstration of 3 pathfinding algorithms using sfml. 

![screenshot](/Screenshot.png?raw=true)

All the code contained in this project was written by me (James Kayes (c) 2017). The pathfinding algorithms were not designed by me, but this is my implementation. 

The project makes use of SFML, which is not my code https://www.sfml-dev.org

Please let me know if you intend to use any of the code contained in this project.
